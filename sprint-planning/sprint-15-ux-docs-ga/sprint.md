## ⚠️ MANDATORY COMPLETION REQUIREMENT

> **OBRIGATÓRIO: 100% dos tickets desta sprint devem ser concluídos. A sprint não será aceita como entregue se qualquer ticket permanecer incompleto.**
>
> **MANDATORY: 100% of the tickets in this sprint MUST be completed. The sprint will NOT be accepted as delivered if any ticket remains incomplete.**

Every ticket must pass its acceptance criteria AND the full health check suite (9/9) before the sprint commit is made. This is the final sprint before GA — no incomplete tickets will be tolerated. The version bump to 1.0.0 must only happen after ALL other tickets are complete.

---

## Sprint Goal Statement

The post-audit stability report identified 4 CRITICAL documentation findings, 3 CRITICAL product findings, and numerous UX/RAI MEDIUM findings. The README is in Portuguese and reads like a changelog, there is no CHANGELOG.md, the version is still 0.1.0, and there is no onboarding experience. This sprint addresses all remaining findings and prepares the application for General Availability at v1.0.0.

---

## Health Check Commands (must pass 9/9 before commit)

```bash
cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --check
cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- -D warnings
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run build
npm run version:check
```

Module declarations in `lib.rs` lack doc comments. Module root files (`hw/mod.rs`, `commands/mod.rs`, `util/mod.rs`) and several HW modules lack proper `//!` doc comments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every `commands/*.rs` module has a `//!` doc comment
- [ ] Every `util/*.rs` module has a `//!` doc comment
- [ ] `cargo doc --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` builds without warnings
- [ ] `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` passes

- [ ] Documents: component hierarchy, state management, routing, i18n, IPC with Tauri
- [ ] Includes a diagram (Mermaid or similar) of component structure

- [ ] All hardcoded strings in `tabs/audio.tsx` replaced with `t()` calls
- [ ] All hardcoded strings in `tabs/wifi.tsx` replaced with `t()` calls
- [ ] New i18n keys added to `en.json` and translated in `pt.json`, `es.json`, `fr.json`

### S15-008 — Fix consent dialog button styling

#### Context

`ConsentDialog.tsx` uses `btn-primary` for both Allow and Deny buttons, making them visually equal. Deny should be a ghost/secondary style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Allow button uses `btn-primary` class
- [ ] Deny button uses `btn-ghost` or `btn-secondary` class
- [ ] Visual hierarchy clearly indicates Allow is the primary action
- [ ] `npm run build` passes
- [ ] No visual regressions

#### Context

`globals.css` `prefers-reduced-motion` only covers two hover effects. All other animations (transitions, transforms, keyframes) are not covered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables all CSS transitions and animations

- [ ] `npm run version:check` is added to `.husky/pre-commit`
- [ ] Pre-commit hook fails if either check fails
- [ ] Hook is fast enough to not significantly slow down commits (or runs in parallel)

#### Context

Release workflow searches for `.msi` artifacts but `bundle.targets` is NSIS only. The `latest.json` upload includes non-existent artifact types (msi/msix/appx).

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Release workflow only searches for `.nsis` (and `.exe` if applicable) artifacts
- [ ] `latest.json` only references artifact types that actually exist
- [ ] No errors in release workflow about missing files
- [ ] `latest.json` is correctly generated and uploaded
